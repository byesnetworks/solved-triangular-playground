Make an application that displays the area of a triangular playground in square feet. It should also display the cost of covering the playground with artificial grass. Make a suitable interface. Provide list boxes for the user to enter the playgroundâ€™s base and height dimensions in yards. Both list boxes should display number from 20 to 50 in increments of 0.5. Also provide a list box for entering the price per square foot of artificial grass. This list box should display numbers from 1 to 6 in increments of 0.5. Make a class named Triangle. The class should verify that the base and height dimensions are greater than 0 before assigning the values to the Private variables. (Although the dimensions come from list boxes in this application, the class might subsequently be used in an application whose dimensions come from text boxes.) The class should include a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a method to calculate the area of a triangle. Save the solution and then start the application. Click the Exit button and then close the solution.
